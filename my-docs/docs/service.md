## Basic Plan
In a basic plan, we perform a survey within the organization, which contains service filed oriented questions for the management and also the employees. Via the Surveys, the business owner(s) can get a reflection how big is the gap between their understanding and the employees. The surveys are always anonimus, does not contain any quateable information to the management neither to the business owners. The goal of the survey is to identify bootlenecks, and have an overall self-reflection of the company and its employees.
Via a Survey we can get a full picture which are the critical problems for the employees, the daily struggels, and also how the management sees the daily business and the blockers.
Normally, there are separate surveys for Management, HR, Purchasing, Sales, Production, Development, Administration, which contains specific questions for their daily business and routines.

We evaluate the surveys, and give a heatmap and priority list to the company, as well as an evaluation how significant changes are need to be implemented in their organization. In addition to the surveys, in the basic package we are also creating a Value stream mapping. Value stream mapping (VSM) is defined as a lean tool that employs a flowchart documenting every step in the process. Many lean practitioners see VSM as a fundamental tool to identify waste, reduce process cycle times, and implement process improvement.
